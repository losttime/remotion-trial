Welcome to your Remotion project!

I heard about Remotion while filling out some job applications and thought I should play around with it. This is the result of that effort. I opted to use the [Typescript template](https://www.remotion.dev/templates/hello-world) (default) because my Typescript is weak, and I ended up having to learn about [Zod](https://zod.dev/) as well. It wasn't the smoothest reintroduction to Typescript.

This project requires Node.js version 16+ and was developed on Ubuntu 22.04.3 (on Windows, through WSL2) with Node.js version 20.12.2.

When you launch this project with `npm start` a browser will open with a non-linear editor displaying the video results of the written code. No editing can actually be done in that view. All editing is done in code.

If you'd like to do something like this from scratch, I recommend going to the [Remotion Documentation](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/) and choosing what's right for you.
